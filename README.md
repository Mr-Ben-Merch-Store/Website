## Want to contribute?

Make sure to keep a consistent color scheme throughout the website. Text color in tailwind is emerald-400, and the background is zinc-900.

When creating any new pages, make sure to use h1 for the main title/text (like "About" on the about page), as this will also give it the bouncing animation.

Remember, you can ask anyone listed as a contributor for help with anything, although it's pretty easy to just copy the layout and theme from other pages.

This utilizes the MIT License, so you can practically do anything with this code.

## Main Technologies Used

If contributing looks too daunting because of the technologies used, understand that they are based on HTML, CSS, and JS. The `.tsx` files are similar to HTML files in that they contain the HTML structure, but they also contain code for interactivity and more.

Here are some documentation links if you want to learn more:

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - This is used for backend and frontend functionalities, and is a metaframework built on React.
-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - This is used for styling. It uses utility classes within the HTML to style, rather than relying on large CSS files.
