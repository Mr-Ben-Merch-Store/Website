# mr ben-yaakov merch store by eshnd
This is a remake of the Mr. Ben merch store website. It's made entirely in basic HTML, CSS, and JS. Originally, in an attempt to incorporate 3D elements, it was going to be made in React and Spline, but due to complications, as well as some performance issues, we decided to make it in DHTML.  

# advantages  
- It's easy to run and edit  
- You don't need a server  
- Not banned on school wifi or goguardian
- There is only need for 1 file of code

# disadvantages
- The animations don't look perfect (It'll be fixed by Monday)
- _index.html_ is overcomplicated and disorganized
- No shopping cart yet
